## Summary by Tier

- **All tiers (Peasants+):** ~60 achievements
- **Knights+:** ~25 achievements  
- **Nobles+:** ~10 achievements
- **Kings only:** ~5 achievements

Achievements are trackable from your existing data model: `entries`, `players`, `games`, `playgroup_members`, `user_profile`, invite redemption, and tier/subscription status. Implementation would require an `achievements` table, a `user_achievements` junction table, and background jobs or triggers to evaluate criteria on relevant actions (sign-in, entry insert, invite redeem, etc.).
